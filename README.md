## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - Vite.js is a development tool that comes with a dev server and is used for modern web applications.
  - It offers a faster and smoother workflow in terms of development.

### What I learned

- I used bing chatbot because I have some trouble with **React** _(Because I'm new to React)_

- [Debounce](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-debounce-example/) - Also learn how to use debounce technic. How it's helps us so much when we're working with very slow API's:

> _Here is the code:_

```jsx
const handleQuotesGenerator = () => {
  getQuotes();
};

const debounce = (callback, delay) => {
  let timeOutId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeOutId);
    timeOutId = setTimeout(() => {
      callback(...args);
    }, delay);
  };
};
const debounceHandleQuotesGenerator = debounce(handleQuotesGenerator, 1000);
return (
  <animated.button className="dice" onClick={debounceHandleQuotesGenerator}>
    <img src={dice} alt="" />
  </animated.button>
);
```

- Also learn how learn how to React-Spring. Such a cool library for react users to create beautiful animations without scratching your head.

- Already learn how to use custom hooks for react components but never really use it for my own project today I also applied custom hooks for my projects.

> _Here is the code:_

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const useQuote = (API_URL) => {
  const [quote, setQuote] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [isError, setError] = useState(false);

  const getQuotes = async () => {
    try {
      const resp = await fetch(API_URL);
      if (!resp.ok) {
        setError(true);
        setLoading(false);
        return;
      }
      const data = await resp.json();
      setQuote(data);
    } catch (error) {
      setError(true);
      console.error(`Error: ${error}`);
    }
    setLoading(false);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getQuotes();
  }, []);

  return { quote, isLoading, isError, getQuotes };
};

export default useQuote;
```
